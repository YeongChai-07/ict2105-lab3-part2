No, the DangerousApp isn't able to be launch directly from the home screen / app launcher and show a toast message of "Application not Found ".
I suspect that it is due to Android System security limitation which prevents users from directly launching the app which enforces with a "dangerous" permission. 

Code Snippet :

<application 
    
    android:permission = " course.labs.permissions.DANGEROUS_ACTIVITY_PERM"
    android:allowBackup="true"            
    android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher" 
    android:label="@string/app_name" android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
    
         .............
         ............. 

</application>

Android will read the entries from the Android Manifest file of the app and determine whether does it enforces any dangerous permission. 
And then prevents the user from directly launching the app from the homescreen / app launcher if there are any of the entry identified.
